## The Problem I Was Solving

<!-- What were you actually trying to accomplish? What was the context? -->

## Why I Chose This Approach

<!-- What alternatives did you consider? Why did you reject them? -->

## What I Tried First (And Why It Failed)

<!-- Document your false starts. What error messages did you hit? Why didn't the obvious solution work? -->

## The Solution

<!-- The actual how-to, but with context about WHY each step matters -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Hindsight observations. Edge cases you discovered. Production considerations. -->

## The Takeaway

<!-- One clear insight the reader can apply to their own work -->
