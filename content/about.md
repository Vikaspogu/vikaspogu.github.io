## Hello, I'm Vikas Pogu

I'm a passionate technologist with over 13 years of experience in software development and enterprise architecture. Currently serving as a Senior Engineer at NVIDIA, working on Infrastructure and DevOps in Omniverse.

## Professional Journey

My career spans diverse technology landscapes, from traditional enterprise applications to cutting-edge cloud-native platforms. At NVIDIA, I focus on:

- **Infrastructure Engineering**: Building and scaling systems that power Omniverse
- **Platform Engineering**: Kubernetes, container orchestration, and developer platforms
- **Automation & DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows, and infrastructure as code
- **Developer Experience**: Creating tools and workflows that accelerate engineering velocity

## Technical Expertise

### Languages & Frameworks
- **Golang** - Cloud-native applications, CLI tools, and Kubernetes operators
- **Python** - Automation, scripting, and infrastructure tooling
- **Java** - Enterprise applications and microservices

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- **Container Platforms**: Kubernetes, OpenShift, Docker
- **Public Cloud**: AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible

### DevOps & Automation

## Home Lab

When I'm not building infrastructure at scale, you'll find me tinkering in my home lab—a playground for testing new technologies, self-hosting services, and experimenting with ideas before they hit production.

## This Blog

This space documents my journey through both enterprise and personal projects. You'll find practical tutorials, battle-tested patterns, and lessons learned from real-world implementations. Whether you're scaling Kubernetes clusters, setting up GitOps workflows, or building your first home lab, I hope these posts help you on your journey.
